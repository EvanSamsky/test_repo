# Research

## Current Projects

### Food Systems and Agricultural Resilience in Eastern Europe

My current graduate research examines how food systems in Eastern Europe adapt to political, economic, and environmental challenges. I'm particularly interested in the intersection of state policy, agricultural practices, and food security in the post-Soviet space.

**Thesis Research (In Development):**
Preparing for fieldwork in Czechia to examine agricultural cooperation models and their role in regional food security strategies. This work is supported by a FLAS Fellowship for Czech language study.

### Ukrainian Agriculture and Environmental Resilience

As a Policy Researcher with the U.S. Department of Interior (Summer 2024), I conducted mixed-methods research on Ukrainian agricultural systems and their resilience to conflict and environmental stressors. This work produced briefing materials for U.S. and Ukrainian government officials.

## Past Research

### The Soviet Stolovaya and 1991: A Culture of Food Aid Before and After the USSR
*Undergraduate Honors Thesis, UT Austin College of Natural Sciences*

This thesis analyzed the evolution of the Soviet Union's stolovaya (cafeteria) system as a form of public food aid, using qualitative methods including:
- Interviews with individuals who experienced the Soviet food system
- Content analysis of Soviet film and media
- Historical research on state welfare policies

The research explored how state welfare, food culture, and national identity intersected from early Soviet history through the post-1991 privatization era, revealing how food aid systems both reflected and shaped social relations.

### The Food System of Bahrain: Analyzing Risks and Possibilities
*Undergraduate Capstone White Paper, UT Austin College of Liberal Arts*

This applied research project assessed food security challenges in Bahrain, examining:
- Historical fisheries and land use patterns
- Trade relationships and import dependence
- Climate change vulnerabilities and population growth pressures
- Traditional crop systems and potential for hydroponic cultivation

The paper proposed food sovereignty strategies that leverage traditional knowledge while incorporating modern agricultural technologies.

### Plant Genomics and Epigenetics Research
*Chen Lab, UT Austin Department of Molecular Biosciences (2018-2021)*

Conducted molecular biology research on plant genomics and epigenetics for three years, developing skills in:
- PCR and gel electrophoresis
- DNA/RNA extraction and purification
- Bacterial and plant transformation techniques
- GFP phenotyping and fluorescence microscopy
- Statistical analysis using R for data visualization and interpretation
