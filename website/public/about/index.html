      <h1 id="about-evan-samsky">About Evan Samsky</h1>
<p>I am a dual Master&rsquo;s degree candidate at The University of Texas at Austin, pursuing degrees in Global Policy Studies at the LBJ School of Public Affairs and Russian, East European, and Eurasian Studies. My research focuses on food systems, agricultural policy, and the political economy of Eastern Europe.</p>
<h2 id="academic-background">Academic Background</h2>
<p>My interdisciplinary background spans biology, Middle Eastern studies, and policy research. I completed dual bachelor&rsquo;s degrees at UT Austin in Biology (with Honors in the College of Natural Sciences) and Middle Eastern Language and Culture (Arabic). This unique combination has shaped my approach to understanding complex food and agricultural systems through both scientific and cultural lenses.</p>
<h3 id="undergraduate-research">Undergraduate Research</h3>
<p>My honors thesis, <em>&ldquo;The Soviet Stolovaya and 1991: A culture of food aid before and after the USSR,&rdquo;</em> examined the evolution of the Soviet Union&rsquo;s cafeteria system as a form of public food aid. Using qualitative methods including interviews, content analysis of Soviet media, and historical research, I explored how state welfare, food culture, and national identity intersected from early Soviet history through the post-1991 privatization era.</p>
<p>I also completed a capstone white paper on <em>&ldquo;The Food System of Bahrain: Analyzing Risks and Possibilities,&rdquo;</em> which assessed food security challenges in the Gulf, examining historical patterns, climate risks, and potential sovereignty strategies.</p>
<h2 id="current-research-focus">Current Research Focus</h2>
<p>My graduate work centers on agricultural resilience and food security in Eastern Europe, particularly in the context of ongoing conflicts and climate challenges. I&rsquo;m preparing for thesis fieldwork in Czechia, supported by a FLAS Fellowship for Czech language study at Indiana University.</p>
<p><strong>Research Interests:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Food systems and agricultural policy in post-Soviet states</li>
<li>Climate adaptation and agricultural resilience</li>
<li>State welfare systems and food aid programs</li>
<li>Political economy of Eastern Europe</li>
<li>Food sovereignty and security strategies</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="language-skills--international-experience">Language Skills &amp; International Experience</h2>
<p>Through various fellowships and exchange programs, I have developed advanced proficiency in multiple languages and extensive fieldwork experience:</p>
<p><strong>Languages:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Russian (Advanced) - FLAS Fellow 2023-2024</li>
<li>Arabic (Advanced) - Arabic Flagship Program graduate, Boren Scholar</li>
<li>Ukrainian (Intermediate) - FLAS Fellow 2024-2025</li>
<li>Czech (Currently studying) - FLAS Fellow Summer 2025</li>
<li>French &amp; Spanish (Intermediate)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>International Experience:</strong>
I have lived and conducted research in Ukraine, Morocco, Estonia, Moldova, and Kyrgyzstan. This includes serving as Resident Director for U.S. State Department youth exchange programs in Estonia, conducting agricultural volunteer work in Morocco, and policy research on Ukrainian agriculture for the U.S. Department of Interior.</p>
<h2 id="technical-skills">Technical Skills</h2>
<p>My research employs both quantitative and qualitative methods:</p>
<p><strong>Quantitative:</strong> R (ggplot2, dplyr), Python (Pandas, NumPy), SQL, ArcGIS, statistical analysis</p>
<p><strong>Qualitative:</strong> MAXQDA, interview methods, participant observation, discourse analysis, multilingual transcription</p>
<p><strong>Laboratory:</strong> Molecular biology techniques including PCR, DNA/RNA extraction, transformation techniques (from my undergraduate research in plant genomics)</p>
<h2 id="recent-work">Recent Work</h2>
<p>Most recently, I served as a Policy Researcher with the U.S. Department of Interior (Summer 2024), conducting mixed-methods research on Ukrainian agriculture and environmental resilience while producing briefing materials for U.S. and Ukrainian officials.</p>
<p>I currently work as a Graduate Teaching Assistant, supporting courses on European history and intelligence studies for nearly 200 undergraduate students.</p>
<h2 id="fellowships--recognition">Fellowships &amp; Recognition</h2>
<p>My work has been supported by numerous competitive fellowships, including multiple FLAS (Foreign Language and Area Studies) awards, the Boren Scholarship, and National Security Language Initiative scholarships totaling over $150,000 in funding for language study and international research.</p>
